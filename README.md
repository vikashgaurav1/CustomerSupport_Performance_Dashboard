## 📌 Why I Created This Project
In many call centers, managers struggle to:
- Track **agent performance** in real time
- Understand **sales conversion rates** per representative
- Identify **peak call times** for effective staffing
- Analyze **customer satisfaction trends**
- Monitor **gender distribution** in calls handled

I built this dashboard to address these challenges, providing a **one-stop visual tool** that turns raw call center data into **actionable insights** for decision-making.

## 🏆 Business Problem
**Problem:**  
Call centers deal with huge volumes of calls daily, but without proper analytics, managers can’t:
- Pinpoint which agents are driving the most sales
- Identify underperforming staff
- Spot trends in call volumes over days/months
- Understand how customer demographics impact service
- Optimize schedules based on demand

**Impact:**  
Without these insights, companies face:
- Inefficient staffing
- Lost sales opportunities
- Declining customer satisfaction
- Higher operational costs

## 💡 Solution
I designed an **Excel-based interactive dashboard** that:
- Consolidates call, sales, and rating data into a single view
- Uses **filters (slicers)** to analyze specific reps, regions, or timeframes
- Highlights **top and bottom performers**
- Displays **gender ratio** and **city-wise performance**
- Tracks **KPIs** such as total calls, sales, duration, and ratings
- Visualizes **monthly and weekly trends** to support staffing decisions
